# Robotic-Arm-Simulation

This is to simulate the movement and controls of a robotic arm. Based off a game I gave up on a while ago.


### Running the code

To run, just make sure you have a c++ compiler on windows thats added to PATH (I've only tested it with MinGW-W64, but it should work with similar compilers). And run the batch file ```compile.bat```. All the libraries should be included with the code.
